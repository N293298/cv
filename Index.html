  <p>I am a musician, a Hardware designer, and a video game tester. I live with my mom, my dad, and my sister. I really love to eat junk food for some reason. I somehow had perfect pitch. With my perfect pitch, I was able to play instruments such as Vocal, Drums, Ukulele, Guitar, Bass, and many others too.</p>
